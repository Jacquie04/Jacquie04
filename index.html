<p>
 <img src="assets/images/placeholder.jpg"alt="MeAlias" style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:10px;"> I have been working healthcare for the past four years. I started as a front desk clerk and put myself 
through school to be a radiologic technologist. Working in medical imaging has been incredibly rewarding,
however, I was introduced to coding by a friend who has worked as a full-stack engineer. 
</p>

<p>
My friend works for a start-up company that specializes in healthcare. He told me that they look for people
with clinical experience and had me try coding for myself. I practiced online but needed more structure with
learning code and found the UCLA-Extension Coding Bootcamp. 
</p>

<p>
I am working to become a strong full-stack engineer to merge my love for healthcare with the innovative 
field of software engineering. I will be looking to work for a healthcare based company since I know what 
the needs of healthcare practioners as well as patients are.
